# Project overview
  
 ## Tap Tune
Tap Tune is a website that allows users to tap a beat or rhythm to identify a song they may have stuck in their head. The user will be able to tap to a percussive or harmonic beat, and will also be able to further filter their search options by filtering by song type, lyrics, or artists. If tapping to said beat is not sufficient enough, the user can also opt to sing or hum the song into their microphone. With the help of 3rd party fingerprinting algorithms and databases, the user will get results in determining what the song is in that front.

Tap Tune allows for users to register and login to save any searched song into their history so they can have reference to what songs they have found. Users can create the Tap Tune account using their Spotify account as well, allowing users to favorite the songs they have searched and add it to their Spotify playlist. In the account song history, users can also find suggested songs for the songs they have previously searched for, allowing users to find new songs they might be interested in.

Lastly, Tap Tune allows users to contribute to adding to the database of songs so that the database becomes larger with more results. Users can do so by adding in the necessary fields in the crowdsourcing section of the website. This will help future users to better accurately find songs they want to find.
